# Ecology Workshop: Latex Demo
## Part 1: Iree
### What is LaTex:
  - A tool for typesetting professional-looking documents.

  - Basically a plain text file that you insert LaTeX commands that correspond with your desired typeset results.

 - Latex is popular in disciplines with complex mathematics, as it supports the typesetting of mathematical equations and other technical content.

 - Overleaf is an online LaTeX document editing tool. Overleaf allows you to create LaTeX documents directly in web browser.

### Why use LaTeX?

- Ease of importing references, the text and paragraph citation features work much smoother than Microsoft word Mendeley or Zotero plugins. Allows for the direct import of bibliography library files from citation software, and automatic development of works cited from text and paragraph citations.

- Easy and quirk-free development of indexes, glossaries, and tables of contents (using section/subsection/subsubsection commands)

- The online Overleaf LaTex platform allows multiple users to edit a document at one time smoother than Microsoft Word or Google Docs.

- Overleaf has many templates for document types created by users. This cuts down significantly on the amount of time you spend messing with formatting reports, proposals, etc.

- Many publishers (including Elsevier and Taylor & Francis) provide LaTeX templates that include their preferred article class and citation styles. Some specific journals provide specific LaTeX templates as well.

- Technical reports, fact sheets, and presentation templates can be found. Once you find a technical report or presentation layout you like, it can be re-used frequently to cut down on future document formatting (Show the report template that Noah and Iree both have been re-using).

- Presentations, a bit time-consuming but can be re-used, and creates a very aesthetically pleasing presentation (and can include animations! – show Noah’s IASNR presentation)

- Thesis/Dissertation template (which Noah will use in a demonstration) from USU has been created – assisting with graduate school formatting requirements.

### Limitations/Complications to overcome:

- Slight learning curve, requires familiarizing yourself with the basic commands and packages (Overleaf has excellent documentation and support articles)

- Some of the very handy features are only available with a subscription (student cost is $9.00/month) This includes track changes, longer compile time, easier reference synchronization

- LaTeX compiles PDFs, if creating Word documents is required the formatting can get wacky in the transfer.

_ If collaborators or co-authors are not comfortable providing comments in a PDF document or Overleaf document (visual editor can be used for this – show – but is dependent on the technology comfort level of collaborator) However, comments can be tricky and require sharing word documents and then manually transferring the comments to Overleaf.
